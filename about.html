    <h2> What is different about Ellie's Cakes? </h2>

    <p> Have you ever met anyone that says "birthday cakes are too sweet"? This one line alone was insipration for Ellie.
        Ellie started baking as a hobby - eventually she became more and more engrossed in theprocess, always trying out new recipes,
        switching between different ingredients to get the perfect taste (her daughters usually being her taste testers).
        <br>
        <br>
        Ellie's Cakes are made with approximately 50% less sugar than other conventional cakes. Not only does this mean her cakes are
        healthier - but the fact that she also uses less butter means her cakes are as soft as a feather.
